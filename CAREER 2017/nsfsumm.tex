% I want to make storage systems easier to configure and easier to maintain
% correctly

% currently, there is a lot of institutional knowledge tied into "tuning" a
% system for optimal performance for a given set of applications.  there are 2
% problems with this: first, the tuning takes time and can be highly fragile to
% small shifts in usage.  second, the tuning requires low level optimization
% that can't be done on shared cloud storage, so often a "best fit" or "good
% enough" generic approach is used, potentially using a coarse, high-level
% characterization such as "archival" that we know is poorly defined /cite~\ian
% 
% additionally, this tuning is specific to a workload and infrastructure (both
% hardware and software) configuration.  Transferring knowledge is difficult
% even between similar scenarios, such as banks using GPFS.  As a workload
% changes significantly, there is no systematic way to transfer previous
% configuration optimality knowledge; you have to rederive it all over again.
% 
% Finally, there is no way to determine a rigorous cost-benefit analysis of
% "should i change some part of my infrastructure" as different storage media
% and filesystem techs become available.  I want to answer "what will inline
% dedup cost me?", "should i add an SSD?", "Do I need more write-cache?".  These
% are all individual large projects in their own right, but what they all have
% in common is a need for a fundamental measure of "what's going on in my
% system", which is our workload blueprint.
%
% Not a fingerprint, because those don't change.  Imagine more of a scaffold, a
% set of instructions that give an idea of what the workload will look like at
% any given time but doesn't fully specify it.  Maybe just skeleton?  Skeletons
% in Storage!!

%  -> what if there existed a quantitative taxonomy of storage workloads?

\subsection*{Project Summary}
%\begin{center}
%A critical tool for accelerating performance in large-scale distributed systems---challenges 
%that may cost millions of dollars and even bankrupt smaller businesses---is the cache.
%In contrast to traditional caches, the modern application-level caches face 
%The shift requires rethinking to tackle the performance challenges of tomorrow's systems.
%With systems facing mounting scalability challenges, 
%time is ripe to rethink the cache abstraction and 
%to address how these fundamental assumptions have changed. 
% ---
%Caches enable large-scale systems to respond quickly to common queries and shield back-end databases from disruptively high loads,
%but are ignorant of their system environment, contents and costs.
%This five-year career development proposal is an integrated
%research, outreach and education program that focuses on 
%rethinking the cache design and abstraction to put
%smart caches at the center of accelerating tomorrow's large-scale systems.

%Modern data management systems are typically optimized to serve a specific type
%of workload. 

%Understanding how storage systems are used is often the difference between 
Data centers consume more than 3\% of the world's annual energy supply---a large part
of which is spent on powering ever-growing storage systems.
These systems are usually designed for idealized workloads, such as streaming or archival, but
the workloads seen in practice are significantly different and variable. 
The annual power waste from poor workload prediction, peak provisioning, and competing storage goals is to the tune of \$3.8 billion dollar per year in the United States alone~\cite{masanet,nrdc}.
%In the United States alone, data centers are currently wasting  
%$3.9\times10^{10}$ kW/h, or over \$3.8 billion dollars, of .

The PI proposes \at{}: an integrated research-scholar program 
for developing metrics, benchmarks and tools for characterizing and dynamically provisioning workloads in data centers to reduce the massive energy waste from storage systems. 
As part of \at{}, metrics such as ``periodicity'' or ``read locality'' will be
mapped to \textit{executable actions} for administrators to improve workload-aware
storage provisioning. As a part of this research program, the PI will develop interactive exhibits at the Atlanta Science Festival to illustrate to the public the type of problems this software can address. As well, to foster involvement of women in data storage research, I will pioneer a Grace Hopper research track to engage the CS community

This proposal outlines the groundwork for a research program to supplant these
broad categories with a set of canonical \textit{model workloads} defined by learned
\textit{metrics}.  


%Currently, many storage tuning guidelines depend on labeling workloads with high level categories such as ``Archival,'' ``Streaming,'' or ``High Performance.'' %Traditional workload labels such as ``archival'' and ``HPC'' 
These labels are poorly
understood and inconsistently applied.  As usage of systems has evolved, the common
language to describe this usage has stagnated in favor of institutional knowledge and reactive storage~\cite{TK}.


The goal of my work in this proposal is developing methods for characterizing and dynamically provisioning workloads in data centers to reduce the massive energy waste due to mismatched 
expectations between storage workloads and data center design. I will develop AutoTune, a %FIXME XYZ thing that does this thing that i need to go reread

%Tuning distributed storage systems as workloads shift over time allows for intelligent trade-offs between %factors such as power, cost, and data reliability, allowing datacenters to better simultaneously serve %multiple clients.
%Modern applications on shared cloud storage have wildly different requirements for consistency, cost, and %latency, among other factors.  Storage elasticity is critical for meeting the requirements of different %workloads as they share the same physical storage, and as the workloads themselves shift over time.

%To better understand how
%workload type translates into system design requirements, a combination
%of longitudinal analysis and statistical feature extraction to categorize
%workload traces and study how the properties of classical workload types, such
%as the ``write-once, read-maybe'' assumption for archives, have evolved over
%time is necessary.  

This proposal outlines the groundwork for a research program to supplant these
broad categories with a set of canonical \textit{model workloads} defined by learned
\textit{metrics}.  Metrics, such as ``periodicity'' or ``read locality'' will be
mapped to \textit{executable actions} for administrators to improve workload-aware
storage provisioning. As a part of this research program, I will develop interactive exhibits at the Atlanta Science Festival to illustrate to the public the type of problems this software can address. As well, to foster involvement of women in data storage research, I will pioneer a Grace Hopper research track to engage the CS community %FIXME this needs some word massaging
 
%A small, fixed set of \mws that are sufficiently distinct, measured by maximizing entropy between %workloads, will  to that
%can be combined to form unique signatures for any specific workload type.  These signatures, in turn, can %provide specific, quantitative suggestions to administrators tasked with tuning storage systems.

%These signatures will provide quantitative
%measures to automatically configure storage systems and improve metrics such as power, availability, and
%performance by mathematically relating storage algorithms with workload
%properties using a notion of \systemfit.

The program addresses three mutually reinforcing \textbf{research objectives}.
%collectively called \smartcache{}.
%comprised of three mutually reinforcing components:
\begin{myitemize}
%\item[(i)] 

\item[1.]
%\item[(ii)] 
%\textbf{(ii)}
\emph{A parameterized taxonomy of \textit{model workloads} will improve data sharing and research implementation in systems.}
 % this includes some idea of global metrics
 % guarantees about temporal durability of said metrics
 % 

The PI proposes to identify a set of canonical \textit{model workloads} to serve as basis vectors for the space
of workload characteristics.  These models will be developed by combining domain expertise and machine learning techniques to ascertain what
metrics are most relevant across and within different usage scenarios, such as
GPFS deployments or high performance scientific experiments.  
%Once a set of
%metrics are identified, the PI will generate a dendogram of metric combinations such
%that properties of individual workloads as well as likely evolution of
%workloads becomes easier to predict.  

%This will be experimentally validated by
%generating traces using the properties of the model workloads and showing that
%these model workloads capture enough real workload behavior that the system
%response is predictable.  
Metric quality will be addressed using
statistics, learning theory, and optimization on 
real-world workloads, and evaluated using both simulations and experiments to assess how well they describe real workloads.

\item[2.]
\emph{Workloads must be automatically detectable and classified into
\textit{model workload} categories.}

The PI proposes to develop a suite of algorithms to identify workloads, defined
as correlated I/O activity, in traces and associate the workloads found with
corresponding model workloads. The PI will focus on isolating interleaved
workloads within static and dynamic traces. Once workloads are isolated, they
will be matched to the appropriate model category through defining a weighted
similarity function. The PI will design an online system to calculate metrics
on workloads and produce dynamic %FIXME word that isn't "hints"
for tuning elastic storage systems.

%proposes to primarily identify workloads using
%filesystem snapshots, which can be collected during periods of system downtime.
The study involves developing low-overhead trace collection for model workload
features, separation of interleaved workloads, and building a web-based tool to
provide workload analysis to the community.
%to both gather training data and provide a workload visualization and annotation tool to the community.
%and system-aware model fitting
%for the workloads that are isolated.  The efficacy of the classification will be tested by interleaving %known distinct workloads and verifying that the workloads are correctly isolated and labeled with the model workload that is most similar.  

% FIXME: Include meta-grouping here for deriving workloads?

%This will be evaluated based on
%performance improvements based on the model workload system parameters being
%applied to the system.


\item[3.]
\emph{Storage system provisioning can be automated and portable.}
%FIXME Maybe put back in?
%The PI aims to develop a
%parametric model of the relationship between storage workloads and the
%infrastructures developed to serve them.  %Given that model workloads are defined by a set of metrics, 

The PI will architect AutoTune, a system that maps metrics to automatic tuning recommendations while accounting for inter and intra-workload metric interactions.  
The PI aims to
demonstrate, both analytically and through experimental validation, that tunings for similar workloads are transferable between storage
systems and that automated tuning improves storage system provisioning in terms of performance and cost.
%are
%more power and cost efficient than systems designed around traditional
%constraints.
  
%\emph{What if data layout was workload-reactive? } 
%The PI aims to
%demonstrate, both analytically and through experimental validation, that storage
%systems designed to meet requirements automatically generated from workloads are
%more power and cost efficient than systems designed around traditional
%constraints. This improvement will be both direct, in the form of procedurally
%generated system requirements for a predicted level of performance, and indirect
%, in the form of better simulated workloads for system testing.  Additionally,
%strict workload characterizations will drive administrative tuning and aide hardware
%procurement and workload placement decisions.

%\emph{What if caches were cost conscious?} The PI aims to generate a systematic understanding of how external costs should be incorporated into cache systems, including
%diverse data-processing costs and performance feedback from external systems affected by cache replacement decisions.
%The study involves devising performance models as these parameters vary, harnessing properties
%of cache algorithms to reduce overhead, and are evaluated based on simulations and analysis of their predictive accuracy.

%%\textbf{(iii)}
%\emph{What if storage system tuning was infrastructure aware?} The PI
%\emph{What if caches were memory aware?} The PI seeks to create a practical theory and programming framework of how data can be represented with fewer memory resources, %in terms of computation and network instead of only memory resources, 
%%can be exploited in the context of caching, devising methods for 
%devising methods for representing cached data in formats that rather use computation or network 
%resources, and then automatically regenerating the data when needed.
%%The challenge of diverse content is resolved through regenerative program snippets for common patterns. %, such as scripts
%%for rederiving data from other cached items.
%\end{itemize}
%The program also implements an \textbf{educational plan} that exposes undergraduates, high school and K-12 students
% to research in computer systems.
%Interactive course materials on caching will be developed
%and piloted for undergraduates at Emory University, and released on a website for use at other schools.
%Cache topics will be integrated in a 
%new teaching An interactive curriculum will be developed 
%The online curriculum features an interactive testbed for analyzing cache systems \textbf{
%developed by the research program}.

%
%\item[1.]
%\textbf{(i)} 
%\emph{What if caches could learn?} The PI proposes to develop and demonstrate a theory of cache learning, a novel concept of exploiting content features of cache items to predict which cached data should be more quickly evicted for optimal cache performance.
%\emph{What if storage system tuning was portable?} The PI proposes to define a
%parameterization
%\emph{What if the cost of data layout was workload-quantifiable?} The PI
%proposes to develop a suite of unsupervised methods to learn features from
%static and dynamic workload
%traces.  These features will be ranked based on their relevance to the
%\systemfit: a measure of how closely the needs of the workload match the
%abilities of a target storage system.   Signatures of features will redefine current workload
%classifications.
%% Below lines are Ymir's, but they're totally applicable to me, and he'd had
%% them commented out.  ASK!!!

\end{myitemize}

\subsubsection*{Intellectual Merit: }

%The research outcomes of the proposal expand computer systems research in several ways.
%There is currently no quantitative method to determine what features define a
%storage workload. 

%I THINK THIS SECTION NEEDS TO START BIGGER.  INCORPORATE YOUR GRAND VISION FOR DATABASES SOMEHOW AND THEN USE THE SPECIFIC EXAMPLES BELOW.  

This project will re-open the field of workload characterization and help the systems community handle the massive,
decentralized data on the horizon from consumer systems such as self-driving
cars or augmented reality.
A method to select predictive, high-information metrics to describe modern
workloads coupled with a way of isolating ``functional workloads'' within a
system will open a new area of inquiry for storage system tuning and design.
Questions such as ``is it worth 1 week of engineer time to reduce this
latency?'' or ``should we add an SSD to a customer system'' will be easier to
answer with a parametric workload model from which to base simulations.

% from existing traces will open a new area of
%inquiry to better design storage systems for a modern workload.
%Automatically determining workload features is critical
%because of the recent shift from dedicated storage systems to shared systems,
%where large amounts of data are placed together and accessed by a dynamic set of
%users and applications.
%
%Obtaining test data with particular qualities is often the most difficult part of
%designing new storage systems or algorithms.

% FIXME Maybe put back in
%Quantitative methods for determining workload features from static and dynamic
%traces will also provide a template for designing test workloads, where the
%over-fitting of the workload to the system is precisely defined and can be
%adjusted based on the design requirements.

%in storage systems research
%to determine what workload features specific
%architectures are designed for.
% (i) shining the spotlight on a component that has tradition all
%a method of determining features of a workload will open up new directions in
%workload analysis and shaping

%that differ from 
%modern distributed cache applications differ fundamentally from assumptions that have accumulated over four decades of cache research,
%the cache abstraction has been refined over the past four decades for low-level system environments 
%including %significantly 
%changes in workloads, scale, performance requirements and memory constraints.
%%

%sets of automatically learned features will allow for a new classification of
%workloads, which will lead to better communication between academia and industry
%as to the requirements and constraints on storage system design.  

% FIXME something about how awesome it is that we have a new metric of system
% fit so we can share workloads better.

\subsubsection*{Broader Impacts: }

This project will give the systems community a standard set of metrics to
express details about workloads used in papers where the data is proprietary,
improving the uptake and reproducibility of systems research.  As part of this
project, the PI will build a web-based trace repository that will include a
visualization and analysis tool. This tool will calculate metrics and offer
configuration suggestions to users while increasing the number of traces
available to the academic community.  This active repository will also hasten
the adoption of standard metrics.  The PI will work with SNIA to ensure that
traces are widely available and a consistent trace format is maintained.

The PI will also pioneer a curriculum to attract students from the mathematics
and data science communities to systems, including a workshop in calculating metrics for the trace repository to introduce local high school students
to quantitative systems research.  This will bring a needed mathematical rigor
to the field while improving representation for women and
minorities.  
%The PI will invove the connect outreach events to the AutoTune trace repository and analysis tools which students can use to
%explore the subject. 

%i(Yeah/nay?) 

%* Start a program to train more mathematically inclined people in data analysis
%for distributed systems.  Data science is super hot, the overlap between people
%who know data science and systems is very low, and this would be a good way to
%get more women into systems since statistically women have preferred more
%quantitative areas of CS like ML and Algorithms and pure math to systems and
%infrastructure, to the detriment of the field.%

% FIXME OLD BELOW THIS
%An established set of metrics and algorithms to tune them will help translate advances in storage
%%design across systems by making storage optimization a modular enterprise.
%Additionally, a common workload characterization will improve communication of
%new discoveries across storage systems research, as researchers will be able to
%discuss the workloads in their studies in aggregate without having to
%reveal any proprietary access data.

%Improving \systemfit will allow the development of storage solutions that are
%better provisioned for the particular likely workloads.
%This will lead to systems with lower power usage and correspondingly lower cost,
%making it possible to store more data with higher levels of reliability in
%resource constrained environments.

%Common language to discuss systems workloads will be key to future efforts
%across the field in sharing datasets and determining how to fairly compare
%systems with different data.
%
%“System Fit” would allow a storage designer to easily determine whether the
%system matched the workload in a meaningful way.
%
%Future systems designs would have a common language to describe the load they
%are designing for, and would be better optimized to the real needs of that load.  
%
%Customers, both in government and industry, would be better able to communicate
%their needs to storage system designers.
%
%Cache operators stand to save both time and resources by shifting away from one-size-fits-all cache replacement and manual incorporation of priorities
%based on performance.
% FIXME
% Our thing lets us throw less data away (design bigger, better storage)
% Lets us better share the resources that we have, since we will be better able
% to articulate our requests in terms of expected resource needs and
% requirements
% lets us save kittens.  Kittens rocks.
%The research outcomes of the project 

%The project will shift the cache paradigm towards endowing system caches with greater intelligence and interaction with
%their environments,
%opening doors for further scientific discovery into making systems components smarter.
%\Smartcache{} addresses mounting data center performance problems by enabling operators to integrate performance-aware caches with modern systems ranging from
%large-scale web services to databases, reducing both programmatic and 
%operational complexity. 
%Because improved cache success rates alleviate back-end system load and reduce response time for end users, \smartcache{}'s
%efficiency translates to cost savings for businesses.
%

%FIXME 
% We have a lot of experience in workload analysis, I/O simulation, and a lot of
% industry contacts to learn what the needs are.  Additionally, at Emory we
% have lots of interplay with the needs of the life sciences, a workload that
