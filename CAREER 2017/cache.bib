@inproceedings{Amiri,
abstract = {Motivated by the need to enable easier data sharing and curb rising storage management costs, storage systems are becoming increasingly consolidated and thereby shared by a large number of users and applications. In such environments, service differentiation becomes increasingly important. Since caching is a fundamental and pervasive technique employed to improve the performance of storage systems, providing differentiated services from a storage cache is a crucial component of the entire end-to-end QoS solution. In this paper we discuss a QoS architecture for a shared storage proxy cache which can provide long-term hit rate assurances to competing classes. The proposed architecture consists of three components: (a) per-class feedback controllers that track the performance of each class, (b) a fairness controller that allocates excess resources fairly in the case when all goals are met, and (c) a contention resolver that decides cache allocation in the case when at least one class does not meet its target hit rate. We compare the performance of various feedback per-class controllers, and provide guidelines for designing QoS mechanisms for such a dynamic environment.},

abstract = {Efficient execution on modern architectures requires good data locality, which can be measured by the powerful stack distance abstraction. Based on this abstraction, the miss rate for LRU caches of any size can be predicted. However, measuring stack distance requires the number of unique memory objects to be counted between successive accesses to the same data object, which requires complex and inefficient data collection. This paper presents a new efficient way of estimating the stack distances of an application. Instead of counting the number of unique memory objects touched between successive accesses to the same data, our scheme only requires the number of memory accesses to be counted, a task efficiently handled by existing builtin hardware counters. Furthermore, this information only needs to be captured for a small fraction of the memory accesses. A new efficient off-line algorithm is proposed to estimate the corresponding stack distance based on this sparse information. We evaluate the accuracy of the proposed estimation compared with full stack distance measurements for 28 of the applications in the SPEC CPU2006 benchmark suite. The estimation shows excellent accuracy based on information about only every 10,000th memory access.},

abstract = {Resources are often shared to improve resource utilization and reduce costs. However, not all resources exhibit good performance when shared among multiple applications. The work presented here focuses on effectively managing a shared storage cache. To provide differentiated services to applications exercising a storage cache, we propose a novel scheme that uses curve fitting to dynamically partition the storage cache. Our scheme quickly adapts to application execution, showing increasing accuracy over time. It satisfies application QoS if it is possible to do so, maximizes the individual hit rates of the applications utilizing the cache, and consequently increases the overall storage cache hit rate. Through extensive trace-driven simulation, we show that our storage cache partitioning strategy not only effectively insulates multiple applications from one another but also provides QoS guarantees to applications over a long period of execution time. Using our partitioning strategy, we were able to increase the individual storage cache hit rates of the applications by 67\% and 53\% over the no-partitioning and equal-partitioning schemes, respectively. Additionally, we improved the overall cache hit rates of the entire storage system by 11\% and 12.9\% over the no-partitioning and equal-partitioning schemes, respectively, while meeting the QoS goals all the time.},

abstract = {Modern single and multi-processor computer systems incorporate, either directly or through a LAN, a number of storage devices with diverse performance characteristics. These storage devices have to deal with workloads with unpredictable burstiness. Storage aware caching scheme - that partitions the cache among the disks, and aims at balancing the work across the disks s necessary in this environment. Moreover, maintaining proper size for these partitions is crucial. The existing storage aware caching schemes assume linear relationship between cache size and hit ratio. But, in practice a (disk) partition may accumulate cache blocks (thus, choke the remaining disks) without increasing the hit ratio significantly. This disk choking phenomenon may degenerate the performance of the disk system. In this paper, we address this issue of disk choking and present a repartitioning framework based on the notion of marginal gains. Experimental results shows the effectiveness of our approach. We show that our scheme outperforms the existing storage-aware caching schemes while supplied with a workload showing the non-linear relationship between cache size and hit ratio.},
