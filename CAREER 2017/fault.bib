@comment{" Big Data will earn its place as the next "must have" competency in 2012 as the volume of digital content grows to 2.7 zettabytes (ZB), up 48% from 2011. Over 90% of this information will be unstructured (e.g., images, videos, MP3 files, and files based on social media and Web-enabled workloads) – full of rich information, but challenging to understand and analyze."}

@comment{Great paper for 'scrubbing can happen in the bakground'
In this paper, we evaluate effectiveness of two known techniques to detect and/or recover from la- tent sector errors, namely scrubbing and intra-disk data re- dundancy.}
