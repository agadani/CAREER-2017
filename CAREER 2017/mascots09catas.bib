@comment{The heat collectively generated by very large numbers of densely packed components within a data center is sufficient to cause catastrophic failure of the file servers. Accordingly, even the earliest data centers were air conditioned twenty four hours per day, every day of the year. These early data centers utilized common window units, but these proved inadequate as computer componentd evolved and consumed higher levels of energy, thereby creating more heat.}

@comment{
By 2011, 97 percent  of data centers expect to be out of power (just two years away!), according to Liebert, a power supply company.
# IDC reports that annual data center electricity costs exceed \$3.3 billion. 
According to ESG, a 50 percent plus annual growth rate is commonplace -- and many organizations report rates well in excess of that, especially in government agencies.
50% annual storage growrh, according to ESG
