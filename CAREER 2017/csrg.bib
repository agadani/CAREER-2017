% This bibliography contains a lot of papers!  Please feel free to
% add more and then commit your changes.
%
% There are a few rules about adding new citations:
% * All citations should include first names and page numbers.
% * The key for a citation should be of the form:
%   lastname:confxx
%   where "lastname" is the last name of the first author,
%   "conf" is the abbreviation of the conference or journal in which
%   the paper appeared, and "xx" is the two-digit year of publication.
%   If a key would not be unique, add a letter to the end of the
%   key to make it unique.  For example, you might have:
%   long:ipccc01
%   long:ipccc01a
%   if there were two papers with "Long" as the first author in IPCCC 2001.
% * Use strings corresponding to conference names.  The string should be
%   of the form confxx, where "conf" is the standard conference abbreviation
%   and xx is the year.  DO NOT USE sequence numbers here (ie, don't use
%   osdi4 for the OSDI that occurred in 2000---we never remember which
%   OSDI is which, but we typically know the year).  For each string you
%   use, create an entry in the top of the bibliography for the string.
%   This entry can include year-specific info (such as "10th Annual
%   Conference on Foo").  You need only create a string if you expect
%   more than one or two papers from the conference.
% * Please keep the bibliography alphabetized by key.
%   Use the emacs command "bibtex-sort-buffer" to do this.
% * "page" fields with ranges are formatted with the "--" dash between
%   the numbers for consistency although bibtex will rewrite them anyway.

                  computer-chip maker Andy Grove, the head of the
                  Intel Corporation. Another chieftain, Librarian of
                  Congress James H. Billington, has set about
                  digitizing the world?s largest library so that its
                  contents can become accessible by anyone, from
                  anywhere, forever. But a shadow has fallen. ``It is
                  only slightly facetious,'' wrote RAND researcher
                  Jeff Rothenberg in Scientific American, ``to say

  abstract = {
Managing large objects with high data-rate requirements is difficult for
current computing systems.  We describe an Input/Output architecture,
called Swift, that addresses the problem of storing and retrieving very
large data objects from slow secondary storage at very high data-rates.
Applications that require this capability are poorly supported in current
systems, even though they are made possible by high-speed networks.
These range from storage and visualization of scientific computations to
recodring and play-back of color video in real-time.  Swift addresses
the problem of providing the data rates required by digital video by
exploiting the available interconnection capacity and by using several
slower storage devices in parallel.

We have done two studies to validate the Swift architecture: a simulation
study and an Ethernet-based proof-of-concept implementation.  Both studies
indicate that the aggregation principle proposed in Swift can yield very
high data-rates.  We present a brief summary of these studies.

                  Provides queueing-based analysis of latency when using SATF vs. FCFS. General
                  model applies to disk or drum. As for the seek issue it compares FCFS with
                  SCAN on a disk. It doesn't do this for drums of course, as there would be no
                  arm movement. The most impressive point is the capacity comparison of SATF
                  to FCFS - proportional to N (number of sectors) times.

              functioning, estimating the mean time-to-failure
              (MTTF) and availability from those measures, and in
              turn deriving an estimate of the mean time-to-repair
              (MTTR). However, this approach had a bias towards
              more reliable hosts that could result in overestimating
              MTTR and underestimating availability. To address this
              bias we have conducted a second experiment, using a
              fault-tolerant replicated monitoring tool. This tool
              directly measures TTF, TTR, and availability by polling
              many sites frequently from several locations. We find
              that these more accurate results generally confirm and
              improve our earlier estimates. We also find that failure
              and repair are unlikely to follow Poisson processes.}

  abstract = {
We present an I/O architecture, called Swift, that addresses the problem
of data-rate mismatches between the requirements of an application,
the maximum data-rate of the storage devices, and the data-rate of the
interconnection medium.  The goal of Swift is to support integrated
continuous multimedia in general purpose distributed systems.

In installations with a high-speed interconnection medium, Swift will
provide high data-rate transfers by using multiple slower storage
devices in parallel.  The data-rates obtained with this approach scale
well when using multiple storage devices and multiple interconnections.
Swift has the flexibility to use any appropriate storage technology,
including disk arrays.  The ability to adapt to technological advances
will allow Swift to provide for ever increasing I/O demands.  To address
the problem of partial failures, Swift stores data redundantly.

Using the UNIX operating system, we have constructed a simplified
prototype of the Swift architecture.  Using a single Ethernet-based
local-area network and three servers, the prototype provides data-rates
that are almost three times as fast as access to the local SCSI disk in
the case of writes.  When compared with NFS, the Swift prototype provides
double the data-rate for reads and eight times the data-rate for writes.
The data-rate of our prototype scales almost linearly in the number of
servers and the number of network segments.  Its performance is shown
to be limited by the speed of the Ethernet-based local-area network.

We also constructed a simulation model to show how the Swift architecture
can exploit storage, communication, and processor advances, and to
locate the components that will limit I/O performance.  In a simulated
gigabit/second token ring local-area network the data-rates are seen to
scale proportionally to the size of the transfer unit and to the number
of storage agents.

  striping unit, although in theory the software could do anything it wants.
  Geared to data-parallel model. Proc nodes (PNs) contact the timesharing
  daemon (TD) on the control processor (CP), who gets block lists from the file
  system, which runs on one of the CPs. The TD then arranges with the disk
  storage nodes (DSNs) to do the transfer directly with the PNs. Each DSN has
  8~MB of buffer space, 8 disk drives, 4 SCSI busses, and a SPARC as
  controller. Partition managers mount non-local sfs via NFS. Performance
  results good. Up to 185~MB/s on 118 (2~MB/s) disks.}

  abstract =     {DFSTrace is a system to collect and analyze long-term
                  file reference data in a distributed UNIX workstation
                  environment. The design of DFSTrace is unique in that
                  it pays particular attention to efficiency,
                  extensibility, and the logistics of long-term trace
                  data collection in a distributed environment. The
                  components of DFSTrace are a set of kernel hooks, a
                  kernel buffer mechanism, a data extraction agent, a set
                  of collection servers, and post-processing tools. Our
                  experience with DFSTrace has been highly positive.
                  Tracing has been virtually unnoticeable, degrading
                  performance 3-7\%, depending on the level of detail of
                  tracing. We have collected file reference traces from
                  approximately 30 workstations continuously for over two
                  years. We have implemented a post-processing library to
                  provide a convenient programmer interface to the
                  traces, and have created an on-line database of results
                  from a suite of analysis programs to aid trace
                  selection. Our data has been used for a wide variety of
                  purposes, including file system studies, performance
                  measurement and tuning, and debugging. Extensions of
                  DFSTrace have enabled its use in applications such as
                  field reliability testing and determining disk
                  geometry. This paper presents the design,
                  implementation, and evaluation of DFSTrace and
                  associated tools, and describes how they have been
                  used.},

	from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to develop the first digital
	object repository management system based on the Flexible Extensible
	Digital Object and Repository Architecture (Fedora) [1]. The Digital
	Library Research Group at Cornell University originally developed
	Fedora under a National Science Foundation Grant [1-3]. Fedora is
	one of a number of repository architectures that have been proposed
	over recent years for use in digital libraries. Related architectures
	have included those described in Kahn and Wilensky [4], Arms, et.al.
	[5], M�nch [6], and Nelson and Maly [7]. The Digital Library Research
	and Development Department at the University of Virginia Library
	reinterpreted the architecture and built a prototype that demonstrated
	the feasibility of the architecture with their large and diverse
	digital collections [8]. Together, the two groups make up the development
	team for the project.},

    Microelectronics researchers have been investigating spin for at
    least 20 years. Indeed, their discoveries revolutionized hard-disk
    drives, which since 1998 have used a spin-based phenomenon to cram
    more bits than ever on to their disks. Within three years,
    Motorola Inc. and IBM Corp. are expected to take the next step,
    introducing the first commercial semiconductor chips to exploit
    spin-a new form of random access memory called M (for magnetic)
    RAM. In this paper, the author describes how the mystical property
    of electron spin is revolutionizing the memory business. If it can
    do the same with logic, electronics will become "spintronics".
